**Week Two Challenge: Chipotle Jr+**

Write a program that will allow a robot to assemble 25 burritos. Use a random generator for each burrito option and build a list of 25 burrito customizations:

 - Rice: white, brown, none
 - Meat: chicken, steak, carnidas, chorizo, sofritas, veggies
 - Beans: pinto, black, none
 - Salsa: mild, medium, hot, none, all
 - Veggies: lettuce, fajita veggies, none, all
 - Cheese: yes/no
 - Guac: yes/no
 - Queso: yes/no
 - Sour cream: yes/no

Start with a minimum of 5 ingredients for a burrito. If you still have time at the end, you can add more ingredients.

If you finish the project before 3pm then display a price for each burrito. Pricing will be $3.00 plus .50 for each ingredient.

Then modify your program to use methods. For example, you can call a method from main whose sole purpose is to calculate the price of the burrito.
